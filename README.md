Computer Vision Project:

To the code, you must have autopy installed. If you have a Windows device then you can simply install the package through the terminal, however, if you have a device that runs on MacOS use this link to learn how to download the library https://pypi.org/project/autopy/. 

After installing autopy on your device simply use the two scripts that are on the main branch labeled as HandTracking Module, and Virtual Mouse. 
If you are using a webcam. change this part of the code for both the module and the virtual mouse scripts. 

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

the device might be a different index, so a webcam might not be at index 0 if you already have a webcam installed on your laptop, so switch accordingly or else you will receive an error.
